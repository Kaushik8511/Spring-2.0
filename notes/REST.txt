***************************REST

Jackson:
	It is a seperate project which is used in the spring behind scenes for data binding
	It converts JSON to java POJO and vice versa.
	
	By default jackson will call appropriate getter/setter methods.
	
	JSON to java POJO => call the setter methods on POJO
	java POJO to JSON => call the getter methods on POJO
	
	While building spring rest applications spring will automatically handle Jackson integration.
	All these happens automatically behind the scenes
	
Data JPA:
	There is a repeatative work we are doing in the JPA for all the entities while doing CRUD operations.
	We can get rid of this using Data JPA.
	You just tell the entity name and primary key.
	
	JpaRepository:
		interface
		exposes methods (CRUD and others)
		
Security:
	Spring security uses servlet filters
	servlet filters are used to pre-process and post-process the web request
