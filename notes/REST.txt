***************************REST

Jackson:
	It is a seperate project which is used in the spring behind scenes for data binding
	It converts JSON to java POJO and vice versa.
	
	By default jackson will call appropriate getter/setter methods.
	
	JSON to java POJO => call the setter methods on POJO
	java POJO to JSON => call the getter methods on POJO
	
	While building spring rest applications spring will automatically handle Jackson integration.
	All these happens automatically behind the scenes
	
Data JPA:
	There is a repeatative work we are doing in the JPA for all the entities while doing CRUD operations
